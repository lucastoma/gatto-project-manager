# Create Memory Best Practices

## 1. Memory Creation
- Create memories liberally for important context
- Use concise but descriptive titles
- Include relevant tags for filtering

## 2. Memory Updates
- Update existing memories instead of creating duplicates
- Expand content incrementally as new information arrives
- Maintain tag consistency across related memories

## 3. Memory Deletion
- Delete incorrect or outdated memories
- Avoid deleting memories referenced elsewhere
- Prefer updating over deleting when possible

## 4. Security & Privacy
- Never store sensitive information in memories
- Validate CorpusNames against user permissions
- Sanitize content to prevent injection attacks

## 5. Performance
- Batch related memory operations when possible
- Avoid creating extremely large memory content
- Use tags for efficient retrieval
