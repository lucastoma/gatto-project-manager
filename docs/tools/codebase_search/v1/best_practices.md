# Codebase Search Best Practices

## 1. Query Formulation
- Use specific technical terms rather than natural language
- Include context like function parameters when possible
- Prefer symbol names over descriptions

## 2. Directory Targeting
- Limit to 2-4 relevant directories
- Avoid searching entire codebase unless necessary
- Use file type filters when possible

## 3. Performance Optimization
- Keep search scope under 500 files
- Use hybrid search mode for balanced results
- Prioritize high-relevance directories first

## 4. Result Analysis
- Check top 3-5 results thoroughly
- Use view_code_item for full context
- Combine with grep_search for exact matches

## 5. Security Considerations
- Validate directory paths before searching
- Avoid exposing sensitive paths in queries
- Sanitize user-provided search terms
